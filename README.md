# Tera-Character-Tracker
This application allows you to keep track of your characters in the game Tera (only Tera EU at the moment).  

It features a packet sniffer and displays data in a material-deisgn-like interface. It also includes a basic notification system to provide info like crystalbind status, credits earned, connection status (more to come).  

Thanks to Gothos, GoneUp, neowutran, GI0 and all other people who worked on Tera data extraction, sniffing, etc.
